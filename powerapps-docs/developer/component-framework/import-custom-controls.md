# Package a code component

This topic demonstrates how to import code components into Common Data Service. After developing the code components using the PowerApps CLI, the next step is to import those components, so that you can see the components in runtime.

Follow the steps below to create and import a solution file:

1. Create a new solution project in the directory of your choice using the command `pac solution init --publisher-name <enter your publisher name> --publisher-prefix <enter your publisher name>` after `cd <your new folder>`. The solution project is used for packaging the code component into a solution zip file which is used for importing to your environment.

   > [!NOTE]
   > The `publisher-name` and `publisher-prefix` values must be unique to your environment.
 
   
2. Once the new solution project gets created, you need to refer to the location where the created component is located. You can add the reference using the below command. This reference, tells the solution project which code components should be added during the build, and you can add references to multiple components in a single solution project.

    ```CLI   
    pac solution add-reference --path<path of your PowerApps component framework project on disk>
    ```

3. To generate a zip file from your solution project, you need to `cd` into your solution project directory and build the project using the command `msbuild /t:build /restore`. This command uses MSBuild to build your solution project by pulling down NuGet dependencies as part of the restore. Use the `/restore` only for the first time when the solution project is built. For every build afterward, you can run the command `msbuild`.

    > [!NOTE]
    > - If msbuild 15.9.* is not in the path, open Developer Command Prompt for VS 2017 to run the `msbuild` commands.    
    > - Building the solution in the *debug* configuration generates an unmanaged solution package. A managed solution package is generated by building the solution in *release* configuration. These settings can be overridden by specifying SolutionPackageType property in cdsproj file.
    > - You can set the msbuild configuration to `Release` to issue a production build. Example: `msbuild /p:configuration=Release` 
    > - If you encounter an error that says *Ambiguous project name* when running the `msbuild` command on your solution. Then double-check that your solution name and project name are not the same.

4. After build completes, the generated solution files are located in `\bin\debug\`.
5. You can now manually import the solution into Common Data Service using the web portal or see [Authenticating to your organization](#authenticating-to-your-organization) and [Deployment](#deploying-code-components) sections to import using PowerApps CLI commands.

## Authenticating to your organization

You can deploy the code components directly from the PowerApps CLI by authenticating to Common Data Service org, then pushing the updated components. Follow the steps below to create the authentication profile, connect to your environment, and push your updated components. 
 
1. Create your authentication profile using the command: 
 
    ```CLI
    pac auth create --url <your Common Data Service orgâ€™s url> 
    ```
 
2. If you have previously created an authentication profile, you can view all existing profiles using the command: 

    ```CLI
     pac auth list 
    ```
 
3. To switch between the previously created authentication profiles, use the command: 
   
    ```CLI
     Pac auth select --index <index of the active profile>
     ``` 
 
4. To get the basic information about the organization, use the command. The connection will made using the default authentication profile. 

    ```CLI
    pac org who 
    ```
 
5. To delete a particular authentication profile, run the command `pac auth delete --index < index of the profile >`. 
6. If you want to clear all the profiles from your local machine, run the command `pac auth clear`. This action is irreversible as it completely deletes the `authprofile.json` file and token cache file from your local disk. 

## Deploying code components 

After you have successfully created an authentication profile, you can start pushing the code component to your environment of choice with all the latest changes. The `push` capability speeds up the inner-developer cycle development as it bypasses the code component versioning requirements and does not require that you build your solution (your cdsproj) in order to import the code component. To use the push capability, follow below the steps below:

1.	Ensure that you have a valid authentication profile created
2.	In your VS command prompt, go to the root directory containing of your code component project in your VS command prompt
3.	Run the command `pac pcf push --publisher-prefix <your publisher prefix>`

> [!NOTE]
> The publisher prefix that you use with the `push` command should match the publisher prefix of the publisher of your solution in which the component will be included.


## How to remove components from a solution

If you would like to remove a code component from a solution, follow the steps below:

1.	Edit the cdsproj file in your solution project directory and remove the reference to the component. Below is an example of a component reference:

```XML
<ItemGroup>
    <ProjectReference Include="..\pcf_component\pcf_component.pcfproj">
      <Project>0481bd83-ffb0-4b70-b526-e0b3dd63e7ef</Project>
      <Name>pcf_component </Name>
      <Targets>Build</Targets>
      <ReferenceOutputAssembly>false</ReferenceOutputAssembly>
      <OutputItemType>Content</OutputItemType>
      <CopyToOutputDirectory>Always</CopyToOutputDirectory>
    </ProjectReference>
</ItemGroup>
```

2.	Perform a rebuild (or clean) by running the command
   ```CLI
   msbuild /t:rebuild
   ```
