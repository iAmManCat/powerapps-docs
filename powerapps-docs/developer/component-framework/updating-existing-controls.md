# Updating existing code components 

[!INCLUDE[cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer](../../includes/cc-beta-prerelease-disclaimer.md)]

If you are a PowerApps component framework private preview participant for model-driven apps and have already built code components, you need to make some minor updates to make it compatible with the new ALM-centric project structures. To use the new PowerApps CLI tooling with your existing PowerApps component framework code component source, a few changes are required.

> [!NOTE]
> This topic is not applicable for updating code components in canvas apps because the PowerApps CLI tooling is not available at the time of private preview for the model-driven apps.  

## Creating an empty project

Use PowerApps CLI to create a new empty project for your code component. More information [Create components using tooling](create-custom-controls-using-pcf.md).
Once the project has been created migrate your code component source to the new project:

1. Copy or replace the component source from the old source file into **index.ts**.
2. Copy or replace the contents of **ControlManifest.xml** into **ControlManifest.Input.xml** file.
3. Copy all other peripheral component resources such as css, resx, img into the corresponding subfolder from the old project to the new project.

## Updating Manifest file

The `ControlManifest.xml` file that defines the code component properties is been replaced with a `ControlManifest.Input.xml` file. There should otherwise be very little change in schema between the two files.
There are a couple of important semantic changes.

1. The `code` resource entry must now point to the pre-compiled source file of the code component. The file name has been defaulted to **index.ts**.
For example, if your component source is implemented in a file called `MyControl.ts`, then the `code` entry in `ControlManifest.Input.xml` must point to that file. The `code` file must also be a valid Typescript file. This is in contrast to legacy manifest files that specified the compiled JS output file in the `code` entry.
2. The `path` attribute of the resource element like `code` or `css` now refers to the local path to the file on disk. For example,

    ```XML
   <resources>
    <css path="css/YourControlName" order="1"/>
    </resources>
    ```

The `path` attribute above indicates that the `YourControlName.css` file is located in `css` subfolder relative to the current directory where the `ControlManifest.Input.xml` resides on disk.
Update the ControlManifest.Input.xml files as follows:

1. Edit the `code` entry in `ControlManifest.Input.xml` to the pre-compiled source file of your code component (typically this is will be index.ts).
2. Edit any paths of the resources to correctly refer to the relative paths to files on disk.

## Updating the project files

If you have created a component using the older version of the tooling and would like to take advantage of the latest capabilities, make sure to update your project files as shown below:

Update the version tag in your pcfproj as follows:  
`<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.PowerApps.MSBuild.Pcf" Version="0.*"/>`

Update the version tag in your cdsproj as follows:  
`<PackageReference Include="Microsoft.PowerApps.MSBuild.Solution" Version="0.*"/>`

## Updating your project with the latest node modules

Legacy projects require the latest npm modules to be retrieved in order to take advantage of the latest CLI capabilities. In order to update the node modules which you have previously downloaded, go to your project directory in the developer command prompt and run the command `npm update`. 

## Using ES6 Module Syntax

The build tools expect the component source to be exported using standard ES6 module format. Legacy controls are typically exported as internal modules (aka namespaces). To align with the new build tools the component source must be modified as follows.

1. Open the source file that implements the code component (e.g. index.ts).
2. Use standard ES6 export syntax by removing the module declaration

     Before:
     ```TypeScript
     module SampleNamespace
     {
    export class TSLinearInputControl implements ComponentFramework.StandardControl<InputsOutputs.IInputBag, InputsOutputs.IOutputBag> {
	      <your class implementation>
	       }
            }
     
      ```
    After:
    ```TypeScript
     export class YourControlName implements ComponentFramework.StandardControl<IInputs, IOutputs> { 
          <your class implementation>
          }
   ```

## Using Generated Manifest Typing file

Legacy projects require manually creating and editing an `inputsOutputs.d.ts` typing file. This file is typically located under `private_typing` sub folder. The new tooling now automatically generate this file upon build. Code-gen ensures that `type` definitions used in the component source code stays in-sync with `types` defined in the component manifest file.  
The typing file is renamed to `ManifestTypes.d.ts` and it is now generated into a sub folder named `generated`. In addition, the `InputsOutputs.IInputBag` and `InputsOutputs.IOutputBag` types are renamed to `IInputs` and `IOutputs` respectively.
To use the new typing file:

1. Import the new `ManifestTypes.d.ts` file by adding the following line at the top of the component source file:
    import { IInputs, IOutputs } from `./generated/ManifestTypes`.
2. Rename all references of **InputsOutputs.IInputBag** to **IInputs**.
3. Rename all references of **InputsOutputs.IOutputBag** to IOutputs**.
4. Build the project to generate a new **ManifestTypes.d.ts** file using the command `npm run build`.

## Troubleshooting and workarounds

1. If you get a 1ES notification asking how pcf-scripts are being used, note that these scripts are only used to build the code components but they are not bundled or used by the resulting component.  
2. If you have previously created a code component using the tooling version 0.1.817.1 or earlier and would like to ensure that the latest build & debug modules are being utilized, make updates to the package.json as shown:
   
    ```JSON
     "dependencies": { "@types/node": "^10.12.18", "@types/powerapps-component-framework": "1.1.0"}, "devDependencies": { "pcf-scripts": "~0", "pcf-start": "~0" } 
    ```
3. User gets the error `Failed to retrieve information about Microsoft.PowerApps.MSBuild.Pcf from remote sâ€‹ource <Feed Url>` when the build fails for authorization issues. The workaround for this is to:

   - Open the NuGet.Config file from **%APPDATA%\NuGet**. The feed from which the user is getting the error should be present in this file. 
   - Remove the feed from the NuGet.Config file or generate a PAT token and add into Nuget.Config file. For example,

     ```XML
     <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>  
     <configuration>  
     <packageSources>  
         <add key="CRMSharedFeed" value="https://dynamicscrm.pkgs.visualstudio.com/_packaging/CRMSharedFeed/nuget/v3/index.json" />  
      </packageSources>  
     <packageSourceCredentials>  
      <CRMSharedFeed>  
      <add key="Username" value="anything" />  
      <add key="Password" value="User PAT" />  
    </CRMSharedFeed>  
     </packageSourceCredentials>  
   </configuration>
     ```
